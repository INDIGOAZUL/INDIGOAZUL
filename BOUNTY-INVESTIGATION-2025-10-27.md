## Systemic Issues Discovered

### Problem: Stale Bounty Labels
GitHub repositories are not cleaning up old bounty issues. Issues remain "OPEN" with "Bounty" labels even after:
- Payment has been made
- Bounty abandoned
- Feature built internally

### Impact on Bounty Hunter
Our automated scanner cannot distinguish between:
- Active bounties (claimable)
- Paid bounties (issue still open)
- Abandoned bounties (6+ years old)

---

## Recommendations

### Short Term
1. ‚úÖ **Filter by date:** Add filter for issues created after 2023-01-01
2. ‚úÖ **Require recent activity:** Only show bounties with comments in last 6 months
3. ‚úÖ **Exclude paid bounties:** Detect "gitcoin" payment confirmation messages

### Long Term
1. **Verify bounty programs are active** before adding repos
2. **Contact repo maintainers** to confirm bounty validity
3. **Focus on repos with active bounty programs:**
   - Expensify (known active program)
   - Check Web3 bounty platforms (Immunefi, HackerOne)

### Alternative Bounty Sources
Consider these platforms with verified, current bounties:
- **Immunefi** - Web3 bug bounties (verified payouts)
- **Code4rena** - Smart contract auditing contests
- **HackerOne** - Security bounties
- **Gitcoin Grants** - Active grant rounds
